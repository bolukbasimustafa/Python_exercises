    "A friend of yours, Julia, goes to New York, US to visit her brother who is studying there. As soon as she lands at the JFK airport, she notices that the US is another world. The distance is measured in miles, mass is measured in pounds, and the temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. She is having trouble converting these values into metric units. Another problem is that she cannot remember the conversion ratios. Luckily, she has you as a friend. In this practical exercise, you will write a number of functions to help your friend in converting these values. \n"

    "## Pound - Kilogram\n",
    "\n",
    "On her way, Julia got hungry and decided to buy some fruits. But she is confused by the weight units. She wants to buy 2 kilograms of apples for her brother. Therefore, she asked you to write a function that converts pounds to kilograms and kilograms to pounds. In this part, you will write only one function which is capable of converting pounds to kilograms and also from kilograms to pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1 pound =  0.45359 kilograms**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement only one function. This function will return the converted quantity. There will be 2 arguments of this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   *quantity*: the magnitude of the measurement can either be an integer or a float. It can be pounds or kilograms.\n",
    "2.   *mode*: this a string that indicates which conversion has to be computed. It can be either \"pound2kg\" or \"kg2pound\". \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 You can use if and else statements to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "💣 Note: In the code we prepared, you can see the assert command. This command is there to make sure only valid arguments are passed. Here we can have if and else statements in the function and in any case where the mode is not pound2kg, the else block will be executed. Even if you accidentally have a typo in “pound2kg”. Therefore, it is important to make sure that the input arguments are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "💣💣 Tip: Always use assert command to ensure that your program runs without any errors. It is a common practice for Machine Learning engineers to ensure if the sizes of matrices are as expected. To use the assert command, write the keyword \"assert\" followed by a condition and then a string to indicate if the assertion has failed.\n"
